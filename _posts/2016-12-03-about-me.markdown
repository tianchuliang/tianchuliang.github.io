Hello, I am Alex Liang and welcome to my personal website. I am currently a master studuent in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and I am graduating this winter 2016. Previous to that, I went to Lawrence University and obtained BA with a double major in physics and mathematics. 

On this site, you will find information about my past projects from undergraduate years to graduate years; each project will be titled: **Project: 'project title' **. For a general summary about all my projects, see blog **My Projects**.

Ocassionally, I spent time on trying new technologies/programming tools/programming languages. I record these ventures with blogs titled: **Trying a new thing: '...something...'**. 

The best way to contact me is via email.
